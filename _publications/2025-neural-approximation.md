## Abstract
This paper presents a constructive approach for neural network approximation sets in the adaptive control of strict-feedback nonlinear systems. The proposed methodology addresses the fundamental challenge of approximation capability in neural network-based control systems by developing a systematic framework for constructing approximation sets that guarantee stability and performance. By leveraging the structural properties of strict-feedback systems, we establish theoretical guarantees for the uniform approximation of unknown nonlinearities while maintaining closed-loop stability. The approach enables efficient learning of system dynamics through adaptive neural networks with provable convergence properties. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving precise tracking performance and robust stability under various operating conditions, showcasing significant improvements over conventional adaptive control techniques.

title: "Building a Smart Monitoring System From Scratch: STM32 + Cloud + Mini Program"
excerpt: "This project showcases an end-to-end IoT solution for remote equipment monitoring. The system integrates an STM32 for processing sensor data (DHT11, ADXL345), an ESP8266 for cloud communication using the MQTT protocol, and a WeChat Mini Program that provides an intuitive interface for real-time data visualization.Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM7fNzV-eL0) here.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
